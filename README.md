# Kubernetes CEX DRA Driver (Technical Preview)

This driver enables Kubernetes workloads to use IBM Crypto Express (CEX) cards on IBM Z and LinuxONE systems through Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA).
It exposes CEX cards as allocatable Kubernetes resources.

The current release supports [KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io/) virtual machine workloads by default.
Native container (Pod) workloads are available behind the alpha `ContainerWorkload` feature gate — see [Requesting queues](./docs/usage/usage.md#native-container-claims), the [`feature-container-workload`](./deploy/kustomize/components/feature-container-workload) component, and [`deploy/examples/`](./deploy/examples/).

The [k8s-cex-dev-plugin](https://github.com/ibm-s390-cloud/k8s-cex-dev-plugin) project also gives Kubernetes workloads access to CEX cards.
It is separate from this driver and does not use DRA.
